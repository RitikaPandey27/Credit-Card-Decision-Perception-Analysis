# Credit Card Decision Perception Analysis  

## Overview  
This project explores the relationship between video exposure, taglines, and demographic factors in credit card decision-making. The study was conducted using Excel and R, based on responses from 1,603 participants. It investigates how income, age, and gender influence financial choices.  

## Research Objectives  
This study aims to answer the following key questions:  
- How does exposure to different types of videos impact credit card decision-making?  
- Do marketing taglines influence the quality of financial choices?  
- What role do demographic factors like income, age, and gender play in credit card selection?  

## Methodology  
### Data Collection  
- **Dataset Source**: Online experiment conducted with 1,603 respondents.  
- **Variables Analyzed**: Video exposure, taglines, demographic factors (age, gender, income), and credit card selection.  

### Tools Used  
- **Microsoft Excel**:  
  - Pivot tables for summarizing data  
  - Charts and graphs for visualizing trends  
  - Simple random sampling for data refinement  
- **RStudio**:  
  - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)  
  - Data cleaning and outlier detection  
  - Visualization using histograms and box plots  

## Key Findings  
- **Impact of Video Exposure**:  
  - Implemental videos (with additional explanations) led to better decision-making compared to baseline videos.  
- **Influence of Taglines**:  
  - Superfluous taglines negatively affected the quality of credit card choices.  
- **Demographic Insights**:  
  - **Income**: Higher-income individuals made better financial choices, but those with extreme wealth did not necessarily choose the best options.  
  - **Age**: No significant relationship between age and credit card selection.  
  - **Gender**: No meaningful difference between male and female respondents in decision-making.
